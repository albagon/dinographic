# Dinographic
-----
An Object Oriented Javascript Project

### Introduction

Dinographic is an infographic that is derived from data provided in a jsonfile, as well as user input data. We use all this information to complete an array of objects that will then be appended to a grid in the DOM.

### Functionality

These are the requirements for the project:
* Generate a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile.
* Each title will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, you will display the name of the human rather than species and no fact is necessary for the human.
* When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden.
* The facts displayed should be random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts (3 should be from the methods you create).
* One of the titles should be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”
